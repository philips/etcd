# Setup a watcher and a setter on a while loop

./bin/etcdctl -o extended watch currentTime
./bin/etcdctl -o extended set "`date`"

# Full down/up demo

etcd can survive a full/up down of all of the members of the cluster

# Add a member- infra4

Add the member:
etcdctl member add infra4 http://localhost:7004

List the member:
etcdctl member list

Remove the member - show that it stops running
etcdctl member remove ID

Try restarting the member - show that it fails to avoid split brains

# Try to add an unknown member- infra7

Note the loglines on the cluster and on the infra7

# Backup/restore
